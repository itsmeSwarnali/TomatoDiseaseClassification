# TomatoDiseaseClassification
This project is all about the examination of the efficiency of different Deep Learning algorithms on Tomato disease classification. I have trained MobileNetV1, InceptionV3 and a custom CNN model on an open-source Tomato Disease Dataset, which is available on Kaggle.

The project is a comparison based study, where, I have built eight different classifiers to classify tomato leaf diseases and to compare which model performs better in terms of different performance metrics and training time. The models are Custom CNN, SVM, MobileNetV1 and InceptionV3 with pre-trained weights and fine-tuned weights, and MobileNetV1, InceptionV3 and custom CNN as feature extractors and  SVM as the classifier.

Objectives:
- To compare the performances of the CNN (Pre-trained) models and SVM
 
- To examine the results of the pre-trained models as feature extractors with SVM as a classifier.
 
- To analysis the performance of the pre-trained models in case of Fine-Tuning and Freezing.
